## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1 Prerequisites

- Access to an AI model compatible with the prompt (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
- Basic understanding of how to interact with AI models
- A clear learning goal or subject area in mind

### 2.2 Setting Up the Variables

Before using the prompt, set the following variables:

- {MODEL}: The AI model being used (e.g., "GPT-4")
- {TOKEN_LIMIT}: The maximum token limit for the model
- {CONTEXT_WINDOW}: The context window size of the model
- {USER_NAME}: The name or identifier of the current user

### 2.3 Choosing the Right AI Model

Select an AI model that:
- Has sufficient knowledge breadth for your subject
- Can handle the complexity of multi-role simulation
- Has an adequate context window for extended conversations

## 3. Understanding the Team Roles

### 4.3 Implementing the Plan

The Teaching Expert [TE] and Subject Matter Experts [X-__] deliver:
- Clear explanations
- Real-time feedback
- Practical exercises
- Simulated discussions

### 4.4 Continuous Evaluation and Adaptation

The Quality Control Expert [QC] and Team Manager [TM] ensure:
- Regular progress checks
- Plan adjustments based on performance
- Maintenance of learning quality and engagement

## 5. Interactive Learning Tools

### 5.1 Mermaid Diagrams

Use for visualizing:
- Processes
- Workflows
- Concept relationships

Example:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is it raining?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Take an umbrella]
    B -->|No| D[Enjoy the weather]
    C --> E[End]
    D --> E
```

### 5.2 Scratchpad

Use for:
- Quick calculations
- Brainstorming ideas
- Temporary notes

Example:
```scratchpad
Fibonacci Sequence:
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
```

### 5.3 HTML Code Blocks

Use for:
- Interactive elements
- Custom formatting

Example:
```html
<details>
  <summary>Click to reveal a hint</summary>
  <p>This is a hidden hint for the learner.</p>
</details>
```

## 6. Customization and Flexibility

### 6.1 Adapting to Different Subjects

- The [RE] identifies required subject matter experts
- [X-__] experts are added to the team as needed
- Learning materials are tailored to the specific subject

### 6.2 Adjusting Difficulty Levels

- The [EP] creates content for beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels
- Difficulty adjusts based on learner performance and feedback

### 6.3 Incorporating User Feedback

- Regular check-ins to assess user satisfaction
- [TM] coordinates team efforts to address user concerns
- Learning plan evolves based on user preferences and progress

## 7. Best Practices

### 7.1 Maximizing Learning Outcomes

- Use a variety of learning methods (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
- Implement regular knowledge checks and quizzes
- Encourage application of knowledge through projects

### 7.2 Maintaining Engagement

- Incorporate gamification elements (points, badges, challenges)
- Provide real-world examples and applications
- Use storytelling to make concepts more relatable

### 7.3 Ensuring Ethical Use

- Respect intellectual property and cite sources
- Maintain user privacy and data protection
- Avoid biased or harmful content

## 8. Troubleshooting

### 8.1 Common Issues and Solutions

- Issue: AI responses are too long
  Solution: Adjust {TOKEN_LIMIT} or request summarized responses

- Issue: Context loss in long conversations
  Solution: Periodically summarize key points and reset context

- Issue: Inconsistent expert responses
  Solution: Use the [TM] to reinforce team coherence

### 8.2 Model Limitations and Workarounds

- Limitation: Lack of real-time data
  Workaround: Acknowledge data cut-off date and suggest user verification

- Limitation: Inability to learn or remember user-specific details long-term
  Workaround: Encourage users to restate key information in new sessions

## 9. Advanced Usage

### 9.1 Integrating with Other Learning Tools

- Combine with spaced repetition systems (e.g., Anki)
- Use alongside coding environments for programming subjects
- Integrate with project management tools for long-term learning plans

### 9.2 Extending the Team's Capabilities

- Create custom roles for specific learning needs
- Develop prompts for specialized learning activities
- Experiment with role-playing scenarios for soft skills development

## 10. Example Usage: Learning Shell Scripting in Bash
